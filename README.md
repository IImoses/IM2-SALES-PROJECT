## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server**: Used for data extraction, cleaning and basic exploratory analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Data Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection & Exploration  
SQL queries were used to load, clean, and explore the dataset. The data was filtered for duplicates and joined across different tables to enrich the analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicate records.
- Transformed and formatted dates correctly.
- Calculated total sales and other important metrics.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis
Some of the Analysis done:
- **Sales by Region**: To understand the regional performance of sales, I aggregated the total sales for each region. This helped identify which regions contributed the most to overall sales, highlighting areas of strong performance and potential opportunities for growth.

- **Top 5 Customers by Sales**: I identified the top 5 customers who contributed the most to total sales. This analysis gave insights into high-value customers and helped understand customer spending patterns.

- **Order Count by Segment**: I explored the number of orders placed by each customer segment. This allowed me to see which segments had the highest order volume, providing insights into customer behavior and preferences.

- **Product Category Analysis**: I also analyzed product categories to determine which categories were the most frequently sold. This analysis helped uncover trends in product popularity and customer purchasing behavior. 

### 4. Visualization  
Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards that provide insights into:
- **Total Revenue**: A KPI card displaying total sales.
- **Sales by Region**: A bar chart showing the sales distribution across different regions.
- **Sales by Customer**: A chart showing the top customers based on total sales.
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: A line chart showing trends in sales across different months.
- **Sales by Product Category**: A pie chart displaying the proportion of sales in different product categories.
- **Sales by Shipping Mode**: A bar chart showing the breakdown of sales by different shipping modes.

### 5. Key Insights  
The dashboard allows the exploration of sales data across different segments, highlighting trends over time, key customer segments, and product performance.
